## How to solve ECONNREFUSED Error

Today I managed to successfully install MongoDB Community edition version 5 onto my Macbook (with M1 chip). I wish to share what I did with you in case other students ask: hopefully it may work for them.

The method to do this involved going through the steps here:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#run-mongodb-community-edition

To assist me with this process I also referred to this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4crXgQZG4W8&ab_channel=MammothInteractive

Once I successfully completed the above steps as per the guide and tutorial video (including the download of xcode and brew), I proceeded to download and reinstall Mongo DB Compass 5.0.9 for Mac via https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community  (this is the step that we did yesterday in class but I believe the proceeding steps are a prerequisite for Mac users).

The above method seems to have worked for me as I no longer get the error in MongoDB Compass that I got yesterday (connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017 MAC) and with a bit of luck it may work for others. It took at least an hour to run through the steps. Before doing anything I would recommend reading through the documentation and watching the video once.

Please pass this on to other Mac (M1 chip) users having difficulty in the hope it may assist. I have posted on the forums, in a my class message, and on the github. I hope it works for the other Mac users.
